Instructions for running Connect-4, by Patrick Eschbach

1. Make and run both Connect4GUI1 and Connect4GUI2.

2. Two identical frames will pop up. Start the one that says “Server Game” at the top first.

3. Click the down arrows to drop a chip into the column below. Whoever is Red during a particular round is the player who goes first. The game will also tell you if it is your turn to play, or if you’re waiting on the opponent’s move. If you’re waiting, the buttons will be greyed out, indicating that you cannot play a chip.

4. Play until someone wins the round.

5. Follow the JOptionPane instructions that pop up. The player who won will first be asked if they want to play another round. If they say no, the player who lost will be informed that they have lost, and both frames will close. If the winner wants a rematch, the loser will be prompted to see if they want to play again. If the loser says no, the winner will be informed, and both frames will close. If the loser says yes, a new round will start, switching off which player goes first, and thus which player is the red chip.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until someone does not agree to a rematch.
